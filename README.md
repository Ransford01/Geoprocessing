Repository for map-based data processing and visualization

Overview: This repository contains maps created as part of the Fundamentals of GIS coyrsework assignment in the Master of Science in GeoInformantion class at the University of Ghana. It focused on assessing urban livability using spatial analysis techniques. Each map visualizes a specific livability indicator overlaid with NDVI, providing insight into different aspects of quality of life across a defined study area and its relation with vegetation.
